## Research

**Tracing Institutional Bias Transfer from Wikipedia to Large Language Models**  
<https://github.com/bxshan/research2026>  
*Independent Research — October 2025 to Present*

**Abstract**

> Large Language Models (LLMs) rely heavily on Wikipedia as part of their training data, yet Wikipedia contains socioeconomic biases in how it describes institutions such as high schools. This project investigates whether these biases—in article length, descriptive language, and geographic associations—transfer to LLMs even when entity names and locations are removed (“blinded”).
>
> By training three GPT-2 models from scratch on controlled datasets (original Wikipedia, entity-blinded Wikipedia, and entity-blinded Wikipedia with high school articles added), this research evaluates whether entity blinding reduces institutional bias and how bias is reintroduced, with implications for safer AI development.

**Developing a Machine Learning Algorithm for Wikipedia Vandalism Detection**  
<https://github.com/bxshan/wikipedia_vandalism_detection>  
*Summer 2024*

Conducted with mentorship from **Dr. Françeska Xhakaj (Carnegie Mellon University)** through **Pioneer Academics**

**Abstract**

> Wikipedia is the largest online encyclopedia and relies on volunteer contributors, making it vulnerable to malicious or biased edits (“vandalism”). This project applies machine learning to improve vandalism detection at scale.
>
> Using the English Wikipedia PAN-WVC-10 dataset (Amazon Mechanical Turk), a linear regression model achieved **80% accuracy**, **76% precision**, **89% recall**, and a **13% false positive rate**, demonstrating the feasibility of scalable automated detection methods.
